        <p><b>GTK Interface</b></p>
    
    PHASEX has a GUI, complete with knobs and buttons for all 145
    patch parameters and switchable color themes.  True fullscreen
    mode, notebook and one-page layouts, and selectable fonts allow
    PHASEX to fit into any amount of screen real-estate comfortably
    (now able to fit in sizes smaller than 800x600).
<br />
<p><b>Polyphonic</b></p>

    PHASEX is polyphonic.  In poly mode, voices are allocated
    dynamically up to the voice limit set at compile time.
    Oscillators and filters function independently per-voice.  LFOs,
    however, function on a per-part basis.  In addition to Poly mode,
    the three legacy Mono modes are still supported: Mono Smooth mode
    puts new notes back into sustain if playing legato.  Mono Multikey
    mode maps the keys played, in order, round-robin style to all
    oscillators based on MIDI note frequencies in use.  In Mono
    Retrigger mode, envelopes and oscillator init phases are
    retriggered every time a note is played.
<br />
<p><b>JACK Output</b></p>

    JACK is used for the audio output.  PHASEX supports any sample
    rate or buffer size used by jackd.  Future plans include
    supporting the JACK sequencer for MIDI input.  If there's enough
    interest, support for other audio systems such as ALSA (w/o JACK)
    or portaudio may be added as well.
<br />
<p><b>ALSA MIDI Control</b></p>

    PHASEX receives its MIDI input via standard ALSA sequencer ports
    for full realtime control over any parameter.  Parameter names are
    right clickable for quick and easy MIDI controller assignments.
    Each MIDI controller can be mapped to up to 15 parameters.  PHASEX
    now supports velocity sensitivity and key aftertouch.
    <br />
<p><b>LASH Support</b></p>

    LASH session managment system provides simple way to store, organize
    and use PHASEX presets and MIDI maps.
<br />
<p><b>Multithreaded</b></p>

    PHASEX uses separate threads using realtime scheduling for JACK
    output, MIDI input, and the synth engine.  The GTK UI runs in its
    own thread at normal scheduling priority.
<br />
<p><b>Oscillators</b></p>

    Each oscillator features wave shape selection (including sampled
    and generated waveforms), bipolar or unipolar output, frequency
    source selection (midi note, tempo based, tempo based w/ phase
    trigger, audio input, or velocity/aftertouch), mix modulation
    supporting standard or AM mixing, per-osc transpose and
    pitchbender amounts, and selectable modulation sources for AM, FM,
    phase offset, and waveshape modulation.  For all but waveshape
    modulation, both oscillators and LFOs are available as modulation
    sources.
<br />
<p><b>LFOs</b></p>

    The dedicated per-osc LFOs have been replaced with generic
    per-part LFOs.  The LFOs are identical to the oscillators with the
    following exceptions:  They are per-part instead of per-voice,
    they do not accept other modulation sources (yet), they are not
    transposed by the master transpose parameter, and when sourced to
    velocity, aftertouch data is ignored.
<br />
<p><b>ADSR Envelope</b></p>

    PHASEX comes equipped with standard ADSR envelopes for the
    amplifier and filter.  Duration times follow a parabolic curve.
    The amplitude of the amplifier envelope follows a logarathmic
    curve.  The filter envelope is linear with respect to the musical
    scale.  Both can also be used as oscillator and LFO sources.
<br />
<p><b>Filter</b></p>

    The filter is a Chamberlin filter (2-pole 12db/octave) hacked up
    so it doesn't destasblize at high cutoff or resonance values.  Low
    pass, high pass, band pass, and band stop modes are available, as
    well as four combo modes.  The filter has it's own ADSR envelope
    (identical to amplifier envelope with the added option of
    switching to negative polarity).  One of the LFOs may be mapped to
    modulate filter cutoff.  Cutoff controller values map directly to
    MIDI note numbers.  Optional keyfollow mode allows cutoff to
    follow the key played for the MIDI note, or the lowest, highest,
    or most recent key in play.  The filter is per-voice in Poly mode.
<br />
<p><b>Chorus</b></p>

    The PHASEX stereo crossover chorus (inspired by the chorus on the
    old Akai S-series samplers) adds depth and that extra bit of
    fullness, and comes with a builtin phaser for an expansive stereo
    soundstage.
<br />
<p><b>Delay</b></p>

    The delay sports the normal mix and feedback controls, along with
    a channel crossover option.  A dedicated LFO allows modulation of
    playback position, great for flange-like effects (or really
    messing with people's heads at longer delay times).  Delay times
    are selectable based on tempo, in both 1/64th and 1/48th
    increments.
<br />
<p><b>Input Processing</b></p>

    Up to two JACK input channels (as mono, dual mono, or stereo) may
    be used as frequency sources for both oscillators and LFOs.  An
    input envelope follower and input boost allow for sources like
    guitar or vocals to be processed with ease.
<br />
<p><b>Stereo Width</b></p>

    The width of the stereo image is adjustable via a MIDI controller
    from pure mono to pure stereo.  Can be used during sound design to
    help create patches that sound very different when a center
    playback channel is present.
